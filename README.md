# supplyRelatedJS

Any code that I use for 883 ACRC, with regards to supply and inventory management, will be dumped here. Anyone is free to take, use, distribute and modify any of these code without credit to me. Please note that I will not be responsible for your use of any of these code, and that I may not necessarily provide support on bugs or usage.

Please ensure that when using any of the code on this repo, that you allow others to take, use, distribute and modify your code without credit to me; however, if you require others to credit you, I must also be credited. This must be present in your code, and your distribution license should in no way contradict with this clause. (Ie, this clause is transitive on any code / product that uses any part of this code).

I reserve the right and ownership to all of the code commited and written in this repo, but (obviously) not the code that you would use on top of mine.
